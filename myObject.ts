//Bad behaviour of objects
const User = {
    name: "Ay≈üe",
    email: "ayse@ayse.com",
    isActive: true
}
//this is not the use case of objects. It is "through the functions"
//either pass objects into a function or return some objects.

//creating a simple method with passing objects:
function createUser({name: string, isPaid: boolean}){}

let newUser = {name: "ayse",isPaid: true, email: "macmac@himail.fifi"} 
//there is a better way to define funcs and methods tho.

createUser(newUser)

//there are other better ways to add other objects when calling the function. Hitesh will show in other videos.
//What happens when we want to return an actual object?

function createCourse():{name: string, price: number}{
    return {name: "react.js", price: 90}
} //case where we return object types.

console.log(createCourse)
console.log(createUser(newUser))

//TYPE ALIASES
